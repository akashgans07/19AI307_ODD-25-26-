## AIM:
To write a Java program that defines a class BankAccount with private attributes accountNumber and balance, and provides public getter and setter methods to access and modify these values.

3. Create public getter and setter methods for both variables:

      getAccountNumber() and setAccountNumber()
   
   
      getBalance() and setBalance()

5. In the main() method, create a Scanner object to read input from the user.

6. Create an object of the BankAccount class.

7. Read the account number and balance from the user and store them using setter methods.

8. Retrieve and print the stored values using getter methods.
